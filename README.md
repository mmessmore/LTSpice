# LTSpice

This is my LTSpice library with added parts I use mostly for guitar pedal
work.

Some are created from pspice models and some are created by hand for
convenience, like potentiometers.

This does have my home directory of /Users/mike in those PSpice conversions.
So if you use this you'd want to fix that.
